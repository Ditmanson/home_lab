The shed started off as a mess. One day I was looking through some junk and found some rock climbing holds. After a bit of time I thought I'd see if I could church it up into something sweet.

# How we started
We have this sweet shed on the property; however, we don't really have anything to do with it. So as it sat there not being utilized, junk storted appropriating.

But then I was rummaging my way through some old stuff and I found these sweet holds.

And I began to have an idea. I thought maybe the shed doesn't have to be a junk room, maybe I could make it something better. So I started moving stuff around, and since then, I've made it a goal to have the shed as cool as it could possibly be with the stuff that I have. Some of my idaes weren't great, but we keep working at it

So after doing as much as I could, I eventually came to the conclusion the rock climbing wall was my best idea. It just sucked at first because I didn't want to go buy lumber. But eventually, I went out and got some.

We are still a little sketchy in places, we need more holds and more lumber, bet we are having fun anyways.

Now we have a full lap that can be made. There's some fun parts, a few challenges, and some pretty technical parts. Here we have what I referr to as jug bridge. It's a little scary at because there's no low and you have to be a bit more bunched up than your probably used to.

And for some of the parts it felt too difficult to do without some extra holds. I since have learned that laps can be done with out these little gimmies; however, it's nice to have. For example, the whitebelt here allows you easy access to jug bridge without having to worry about the 90 degree transition of walls.
